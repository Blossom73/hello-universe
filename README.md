# hello-universe
Three years ago, I opened a repository titled 'hello-world'; I cannot be sure that I really understood what I was doing, so 'hello-universe'! Following the 'GitHub Guides', this exercise requires me to edit my original README on this branch for the purpose of demonstrating that the master will remain unchanged - for the moment. My edit takes the form of two questions:
 
1. Why have I been away for so long?
Ans: to acquire the knowledge, understanding and skills which would give me a better understanding of 'what I was doing'

2. Why have I returned to GitHub?
There are two answers to this question:
  (i) although still working towards the k, u and s to which I aspire - metaphorical mountain climbing with constantly distant perspective of summit - ready to 'dip toe in the water'; and,
  (ii) a 'real' purpose for a repository - pseudo-research information (non-sensitive) repository and data analysis
